# I have no idea what I am doing

I overworked my hand like uhh 6 months ago from playing too much MinecraftTM, so now I wanna make a timer to take frequent breaks

Again I have no clue what I'm doing, but why not learn GitHub while learning Python at the same time!

Current plan:

1. Make some shitty GUI in tkinter (yes I know other better things for GUIs exist)
2. Make it so you can set a custom timer
3. Make it so you can select the alarm sound that plays when the timer is up
4. ????
5. Profit

Made in python 3.13
